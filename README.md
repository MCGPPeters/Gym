### Visualization
The Avalonia UI provides real-time physics visualization with:
- **Real-time body rendering** showing actual physics object positions and rotations
- **Visual feedback** for forces, velocities, and contact points
- **Interactive controls** for stepping through physics simulation
- **Debug information** displaying physics state values

## Getting Started
1. Build the solution:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```
2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```
3. Create a NuGet package:
   ```bash
   dotnet pack Gymnasium/Gymnasium.csproj -c Release
   ```
4. Run the Avalonia UI:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project Gymnasium.UI
   ```

## CI/CD
- See `.github/workflows/dotnet.yml` for build, test, and pack pipeline (full git history is fetched for versioning).
- Semantic versioning is managed by Nerdbank.GitVersioning (`version.json`).
- Test step uses `dotnet test --configuration Release --no-build --logger "trx;LogFileName=test_results.trx"` for compatibility with GitHub Actions.
